# TroubleShooting Autosynth failures

Autosynth fails when the code in your `synth.py` fails, so please carefully inspect
the `synth.py` log listed in the issue body.  Most issues can be diagnosed by 
carefully inspecting the log.

[README.md](../synthool/README.md) contains instructions for running `synth.py` locally
to test your fix.
